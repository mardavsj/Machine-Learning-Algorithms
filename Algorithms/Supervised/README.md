# What is Supervised Learning ?

Supervised learning is a machine learning method in which models are trained using labeled data. In supervised learning, models need to find the mapping function to map the input variable (X) with the output variable (Y). 

Supervised learning needs supervision to train the model, which is similar to as a student learns things in the presence of a teacher. Supervised learning can be used for two types of problems: Classification and Regression.
