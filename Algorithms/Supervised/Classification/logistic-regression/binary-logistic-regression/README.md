# What is Binary Logistic Regression ?

Binary logistic regression (LR) is a regression model where the target variable is binary, that is, it can take only two values, 0 or 1. It is the most utilized regression model in readmission prediction, given that the output is modelled as readmitted (1) or not readmitted (0).
