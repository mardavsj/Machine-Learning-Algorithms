# What is Naive Bayes Algorithm ?

Bayes' theorem is also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' law, which is used to determine the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on the conditional probability. 

It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object. 

The formula for Bayes' theorem is given as:

where, P(A|B) = Posterior probability
P(B|A) = Likelihood probability
P(A) = Prior Probability
P(B) = Marginal Probability
