# What is Polynomial regression ?

A polynomial regression model is a machine learning model that can capture non-linear relationships between variables by fitting a non-linear regression line, which may not be possible with simple linear regression.

# Formula for polynomial regression :

# y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₁² +........bnx₁ⁿ

where,  y = dependent variable;     
        x₁ = expanatory variables;   
        b = y-intercept;    
        bn = slope
