# What is Regression ? 

Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. 

The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y).
