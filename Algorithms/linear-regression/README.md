What is Linear Regression ?


Linear regression is a data analysis technique that predicts the value of unknown data by using another related and known data value. It mathematically models the unknown or dependent variable and the known or independent variable as a linear equation.

For Example: The weight of the person is linearly related to their height. So, this shows a linear relationship between the height and weight of the person.


There are two types of linear regression models:-
1) Single Linear Regression:- A linear regression model with one independent and one dependent variable.
2) Multi Linear Regression:- A linear regression model with more than one independent variable and one dependent variable.
