# What is Logistic Regression ?

Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set.

For example: A political candidate will win or lose an election or whether a high school student will be admitted or not to a particular college.

# There are three types of logistic regression models:-

1. Binary Logistic Regression:- It is a regression model where the target variable is binary.
2. Multinomial Logistic Regression:- It is to predict membership of more than two categories.
3. Ordinal Logistic Regression:- It is a statistical test used to predict a single ordered categorical variable using one or more other variables.
