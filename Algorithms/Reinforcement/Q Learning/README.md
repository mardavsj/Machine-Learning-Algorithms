# What is Q Learning ?

Q-Learning is a basic form of Reinforcement Learning which uses Q-values (also called action values) to iteratively improve the behavior of the learning agent.

In a simple way - find the best series of actions based on the agent's current state.

Here, the Q stands for Quality.
