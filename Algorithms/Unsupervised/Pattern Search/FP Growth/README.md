# What is FP Growth ?

The FP-Growth Algorithm is an alternative way to find frequent item sets without using candidate generations, thus improving performance. For so much, it uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. The core of this method is the usage of a special data structure named frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree), which retains the item set association information.
