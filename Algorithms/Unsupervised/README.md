# What is Unsupervised Learning ?

Unsupervised learning is another machine learning method in which patterns inferred from the unlabeled input data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the structure and patterns from the input data. Unsupervised learning does not need any supervision. Instead, it finds patterns from the data by its own. 

Unsupervised learning can be used for two types of problems: Clustering and Association.
