 Machine-Learning-Algorithms
 
 This repository will cover both the supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
 Various algorithms will be explored, which are as follows:
 
 1. Linear Regression
 2. Logistic Regression
 3. Decision tree
 4. Random forest
 5. Naive Bayes Classifer
 6. Clustering
 
 This repository will also be beneficial for networks like Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.
